# tor-browser-protocol
Allows you to open a link from one browser in the Tor Browser.

Instead of using https or http to open a link, using tor-browser will open the link in the Tor Browser from whatever browser you are currently in.

So for example, you could enter "[tor-browser://www.torproject.org](tor-browser://www.torproject.org)" and it'll open that website inside of Tor. Of course though, you'll need Tor already installed. In order for the script to work, you MUST place it in the "Tor Browser" directory and then run it.
